    The Intel&reg; RealSense&trade; SDK for Linux provides libraries, tools and
    samples to develop applications using Intel RealSense cameras by
    using the librealsense API. The SDK provides functionality of record
    and playback of camera streams for test and validation. The SDK
    includes libraries which support the camera stream projection of
    streams into a common world-space viewpoint, and libraries which
    enable use of multiple middleware modules simultaneously for common
    multi-modal scenarios.<br><br>
